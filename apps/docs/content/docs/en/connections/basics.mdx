## How Connections Work

Connections are the pathways that allow data to flow between blocks in your workflow. In Sim, connections define how information passes from one block to another, enabling data flow throughout your workflow.

<Callout type="info">
  Each connection represents a directed relationship where data flows from a source block's output
  to a destination block's input.
</Callout>

### Creating Connections

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <strong>Select Source Block</strong>: Click on the output port of the block you want to connect
    from
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Draw Connection</strong>: Drag to the input port of the destination block
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Confirm Connection</strong>: Release to create the connection
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Connection Flow

The flow of data through connections follows these principles:

1. **Directional Flow**: Data always flows from outputs to inputs
2. **Execution Order**: Blocks execute in order based on their connections
3. **Data Transformation**: Data may be transformed as it passes between blocks
4. **Conditional Paths**: Some blocks (like Router and Condition) can direct flow to different paths

<Callout type="warning">
  Deleting a connection will immediately stop data flow between the blocks. Make sure this is
  intended before removing connections.
