{/* MANUAL-CONTENT-START:intro */}
[Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) is a robust communication and collaboration platform that enables users to engage in real-time messaging, meetings, and content sharing within teams and organizations. As part of Microsoft's productivity ecosystem, Microsoft Teams offers seamless chat functionality integrated with Office 365, allowing users to post messages, coordinate work, and stay connected across devices and workflows.

With Microsoft Teams, you can:

- **Send and receive messages**: Communicate instantly with individuals or groups in chat threads  
- **Collaborate in real-time**: Share updates and information across teams within channels and chats  
- **Organize conversations**: Maintain context with threaded discussions and persistent chat history  
- **Share files and content**: Attach and view documents, images, and links directly in chat  
- **Integrate with Microsoft 365**: Seamlessly connect with Outlook, SharePoint, OneDrive, and more  
- **Access across devices**: Use Teams on desktop, web, and mobile with cloud-synced conversations  
- **Secure communication**: Leverage enterprise-grade security and compliance features

In Sim, the Microsoft Teams integration enables your agents to interact directly with chat messages programmatically. This allows for powerful automation scenarios such as sending updates, posting alerts, coordinating tasks, and responding to conversations in real time. Your agents can write new messages to chats or channels, update content based on workflow data, and engage with users where collaboration happens. By integrating Sim with Microsoft Teams, you bridge the gap between intelligent workflows and team communication â€” empowering your agents to streamline collaboration, automate communication tasks, and keep your teams aligned.
