{/* MANUAL-CONTENT-START:intro */}
[OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com) is Microsoft’s cloud storage and file synchronization service that allows users to securely store, access, and share files across devices. Integrated deeply into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, OneDrive supports seamless collaboration, version control, and real-time access to content across teams and organizations.

Learn how to integrate the OneDrive tool in Sim to automatically pull, manage, and organize your cloud files within your workflows. This tutorial walks you through connecting OneDrive, setting up file access, and using stored content to power automation. Ideal for syncing essential documents and media with your agents in real time.

With OneDrive, you can:

- **Store files securely in the cloud**: Upload and access documents, images, and other files from any device
- **Organize your content**: Create structured folders and manage file versions with ease
- **Collaborate in real time**: Share files, edit them simultaneously with others, and track changes
- **Access across devices**: Use OneDrive from desktop, mobile, and web platforms
- **Integrate with Microsoft 365**: Work seamlessly with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Teams
- **Control permissions**: Share files and folders with custom access settings and expiration controls

In Sim, the OneDrive integration enables your agents to directly interact with your cloud storage. Agents can upload new files to specific folders, retrieve and read existing files, and list folder contents to dynamically organize and access information. This integration allows your agents to incorporate file operations into intelligent workflows — automating document intake, content analysis, and structured storage management. By connecting Sim with OneDrive, you empower your agents to manage and use cloud documents programmatically, eliminating manual steps and enhancing automation with secure, real-time file access.
