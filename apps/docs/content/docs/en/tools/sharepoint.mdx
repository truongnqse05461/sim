{/* MANUAL-CONTENT-START:intro */}
[SharePoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration) is a collaborative platform from Microsoft that enables users to build and manage internal websites, share documents, and organize team resources. It provides a powerful, flexible solution for creating digital workspaces and streamlining content management across organizations.

With SharePoint, you can:

- **Create team and communication sites**: Set up pages and portals to support collaboration, announcements, and content distribution
- **Organize and share content**: Store documents, manage files, and enable version control with secure sharing capabilities
- **Customize pages**: Add text parts to tailor each site to your team's needs
- **Improve discoverability**: Use metadata, search, and navigation tools to help users quickly find what they need
- **Collaborate securely**: Control access with robust permission settings and Microsoft 365 integration

In Sim, the SharePoint integration empowers your agents to create and access SharePoint sites and pages as part of their workflows. This enables automated document management, knowledge sharing, and workspace creation without manual effort. Agents can generate new project pages, upload or retrieve files, and organize resources dynamically, based on workflow inputs. By connecting Sim with SharePoint, you bring structured collaboration and content management into your automation flows â€” giving your agents the ability to coordinate team activities, surface key information, and maintain a single source of truth across your organization.
